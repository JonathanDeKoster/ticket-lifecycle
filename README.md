# osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a help desk ticket in osTicket, from initial user submission through troubleshooting, communication, and final resolution. The lab mirrors real-world IT support workflows and agent responsibilities.

This project builds on my OS Ticket installation and post-installation configuration labs.

**Objective**

Simulate a realistic help desk environment by managing tickets through each stage of the support lifecycle, including intake, assignment, communication, troubleshooting, and closure.

**What This Lab Covers**

- Ticket creation from an end-user perspective

- Assignment to agents or teams

- Agent-user communication and status updates

- Troubleshooting and documentation within tickets

- Resolution and ticket closure

**Ticket Lifecycle Stages**

**1. Intake** – Ticket created by an end user

**2. Assignment & Communication** – Ticket assigned to an agent or team; initial response provided

**3. Working the Issue** – Troubleshooting steps documented and updates communicated

**4. Resolution** – Issue resolved and ticket closed
